<h1>The Best Movies According to Shruti</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Pathaan </h3>
<p>Stylish, slick and action-packed film; in one word it’s a ‘Blockbuster’. Film has actions, thrills, bit of suspense and gripping storyline.</p>
<h3>Haseen Dillruba</h3>
<p>AN EPIC SAGA OF LOVE & THRILL- that you simply cannot(shouldn't) miss!</p>
<h3>The Kerala Story</h3>
<p>The movie does an excellent job of raising awareness about the dangers of radicalization and how it impacts communities. It sheds light on the methods used by extremist groups to manipulate vulnerable individuals, and it humanizes the victims, showing the struggles faced by families and communities affected by radicalization.</p>
